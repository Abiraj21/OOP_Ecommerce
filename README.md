📱 Mobile Shop E-Commerce Application

This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based e-commerce web application developed to simulate a real-world online mobile shopping platform. The system demonstrates core OOP principles including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, while implementing practical functionalities commonly found in modern e-commerce systems.

The application was developed using Java as the primary backend programming language, applying structured OOP design to ensure scalability, maintainability, and modular development. A SQL database was integrated to handle persistent data storage such as product details, user information, and authentication records. The frontend interface was designed using HTML and CSS, providing a simple, responsive, and user-friendly shopping experience.
